      <description>IntroductionThe heritability values obtained from the previous GWAS using lmm and lrt appear to be artificially inflated. Therefore, beta values may be a better indication of SNP effect, which can be obtained by using the wald test, instead of lrt.

      <description>IntroductionThe addition of covariates to the heritability and GWAS models significantly changed my results. As such, I need to filter for robust peaks in my new GWAS results and obtaining beta-values for the signiicant peaks.

      <description>IntroductionAfter trying GCTA for estimating the heritability of individual traits and comparing its results with results obtained from gaston, the heritability of the phenotypic PCs need to be estimated as well.
Methods and Results1. Prepare principal component resultsGCTA requires the phenotypic input file to be a plain text file and have the family and UUID in the first two columns and it does not recognise headers. I converted the csv file to text file, removed the headers, and added a family ID column.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAlthough heritability estimates have been obtained from gaston, I was unable to obtain signficance values for the estimates. This is important as it will help me prioritise the phenotypes and principal components that will be carried forward to the pedigree-based GWAS. Therefore, I will attempt to re-calculate the heritability estimates using GCTA (http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#Overview). GCTA is a command line program that uses PLINK input and output.

      <description>IntroductionRecent studies suggest that hidden population stratification can singificantly inflate heritability estimates. It is therefore imperative that population structure is accounted for when estimating heritability by including principal components in the linear mixed model. Typically, 10 to 20 principal components are used for this correction in outbred populations, but these numbers have no theoretical basis. A paper by Dandine-Roulland et al. (2016) has shown that heritability estimates are significantly affected with the inclusion of the first principal component, but not of any more (https://www.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe genetic relationship matrix generated from the previous exercise contains values that signify the degree of relatedness between the individuals. This will allow me to estimate the heritability of the traits and principal components identified in the first objective.
To recap this concept, traits can vary among individuals due to environmental and genetic factors. Estimating the heritability of a trait means determining the proportion of variance that can be attributed to genetics (https://www.</description>
