      <description>IntroductionThe heritability values obtained from the previous GWAS using lmm and lrt appear to be artificially inflated. Therefore, beta values may be a better indication of SNP effect, which can be obtained by using the wald test, instead of lrt.

      <description>IntroductionThe pedigree-based GWAS identified 9 heritable traits with significant hits (i.e.Â SNPs that pass genome-wide significance threshold, p &amp;lt; 1.84e-7). The number of significant hits within each trait highly varied. To identify the most robust hits, SNPs that pass the genome-wide signficance threshold would ideally have adjacent SNPs that pass the suggestive threshold. Therefore, I will attempt to filter the significant hits/loci based on the presence of significant (suggestive) SNPs.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter obtaining heritability estimates for all traits and principal components, I can prioritise the traits for GWAS. There are different methods for performing GWAS and analysing GWAS results in GCTA. In particular, I am interested in the MLMA method which is mixed linear model associations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473328).
Methods and Results1. Run GWAS-MLMA on R K-value V./gcta64 --mlma --bfile merged_nies/merged_nies_geno_210818 --grm gcta_output/merged_nies_grm --pheno nies_pheno_020918.txt --mpheno 11 --out gcta_output/r_kval_mlmar_kvalV_mlma &amp;lt;- read.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter trying GCTA for estimating the heritability of individual traits and comparing its results with results obtained from gaston, the heritability of the phenotypic PCs need to be estimated as well.
Methods and Results1. Prepare principal component resultsGCTA requires the phenotypic input file to be a plain text file and have the family and UUID in the first two columns and it does not recognise headers. I converted the csv file to text file, removed the headers, and added a family ID column.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAlthough heritability estimates have been obtained from gaston, I was unable to obtain signficance values for the estimates. This is important as it will help me prioritise the phenotypes and principal components that will be carried forward to the pedigree-based GWAS. Therefore, I will attempt to re-calculate the heritability estimates using GCTA (http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#Overview). GCTA is a command line program that uses PLINK input and output.

      <description>IntroductionRecent studies suggest that hidden population stratification can singificantly inflate heritability estimates. It is therefore imperative that population structure is accounted for when estimating heritability by including principal components in the linear mixed model. Typically, 10 to 20 principal components are used for this correction in outbred populations, but these numbers have no theoretical basis. A paper by Dandine-Roulland et al. (2016) has shown that heritability estimates are significantly affected with the inclusion of the first principal component, but not of any more (https://www.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe genetic relationship matrix generated from the previous exercise contains values that signify the degree of relatedness between the individuals. This will allow me to estimate the heritability of the traits and principal components identified in the first objective.
To recap this concept, traits can vary among individuals due to environmental and genetic factors. Estimating the heritability of a trait means determining the proportion of variance that can be attributed to genetics (https://www.</description>

      <description>require(gaston)IntroductionGaston is an R package that allows for manipulation and analysis of SNP data. For this project, it will be used to estimate heritability of the phenotypes and perform the pedigree-based linear mixed model GWAS (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gaston/vignettes/gaston.pdf).
Methods and Results1. Re-filter the SNP data.In the previous entry, I manually subsetted data for individuals before merging the data sets such that PLINK does not have to handle duplicate samples.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter addressing the missing genotype filtering issue, the PCA on the final data set will need to be repeated. Performing a PCA will reveal population structure and will reveal any underlying genetic structures in the genomic data.
Methods and ResultsNote: I forgot to change the paternal and maternal IDs before I re-did the merge and it seemed to be causing issues with the PCA. I changed the paternal and maternal IDs in the final data set (nies_miss_filtered) ONLY.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe missing genotype filtering is still removing more variants than expected. We suspect that PLINK may not be handling the overlapping data/duplicate samples well. Therefore, I will be removing the SNP-array data for individuals that have duplicate data before attempting to merge the data set using the default setting (consensus calls) in PLINK.
Methods and Results1. Identify individuals with SNP-array only and duplicate data.Using the master spreadsheet containing UUIDs, I 1) isolated all NIES individuals, 2) isolated NIES individuals with SNP data (GWAS_NIES), 3) separate individuals with potential duplicates and SNP-array data.</description>

      <description>IntroductionApplying a missing genotype filter for individuals and markers (described in previous entry) yielded unexpected results as a significant number of individuals and variants were removed. Considering the high genotyping rates (~99%) of the original files (WGS and SNP-array), there should only be a small number of variants removed due to missing genotypes.
This exercise is aimed at determining the possible cause for this filtering issue by testing the filtering parameters on the original data set and merged data set.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe final step to the second part of aim 1 is to perform a PCA on the genomic data to investigate the population structure. This is important because it will allow me to determine if there are any underlying genetic structures in the genomic data and I can account for relatedness among individuals for subsequent analyses.
Methods and Results1. Run PCAplink1.9 --bfile merged_nies --pca 180 var-wts --out plink_output/nies_final_pcaThe count had to be increased (default is 20) because there are over 100 components with an eigenvalue &amp;gt;1.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter performing basic stats and QC on the genomic data sets, merging, and subsetting the data for NIES individuals, a few issues came to my attention. Firstly, from the histograms of the distribution of allele frequencies from the whole genome sequencing data, it became evident that the data had been filtered to exlude SNPs with MAF &amp;lt; 0.05. Thus any rare variants that I need for GWAS was excluded. Second, the IDs in the whole genome sequencing data were not UUIDs.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter extracting data for the common variants, the last cleaning step is to extract genomic data for NIES individuals only. Unique identifiers are used for individuals and a unique list of UUIDs need to be identified to extract the relevant data.
Methods and ResultsLoad .fam file from the merged data set. (.fam file contains UUIDs of individuals with genomic data)merged_fam_data &amp;lt;- read.table(&amp;#39;C:/Users/Martha/Documents/Honours/Project/honours.project/Data/plink_output/common_id_merge.fam&amp;#39;, header = F)head(merged_fam_data)## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6## 1 1 110050 764 368910 1 -9## 2 1 110110 2621 400796 1 -9## 3 1 110130 2994 2330 1 -9## 4 1 110150 0 0 2 -9## 5 1 110160 2070 2071 1 -9## 6 1 110320 4462 6317 1 -92.</description>

      <description>IntroductionError when extracting common variant IDs needs to be resolved.
After successfully exporting the list of common IDs, the relevant genomic data will need to be extracted and basic statistics will need to be generated.
Methods and resultsI believe the error in PLINK when extracting data is due to the formatting of the IDs in the text file.
1.Try removing quotation marks from the list of IDs</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe merged data set did not produce the expected output. I expected that the merging would only retain data from common variants between both genomic data sets. To resolve this, I need to compare the two data sets and extract the list of common variant IDs and use this to extract the relevant data.
Methods1.Load .bim files for both data sets
wgs_bim_data &amp;lt;- read.table(&amp;#39;C:/Users/Martha/Documents/Honours/Project/honours.project/Data/NI_wgs_merged_snps.bim&amp;#39;, header = F)head(wgs_bim_data)## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6## 1 1 1:11075 0 11075 A G## 2 1 rs546169444 0 14464 T A## 3 1 rs2691315 0 15820 T G## 4 1 rs375964566 0 15922 G A## 5 1 rs112448831 0 15956 A G## 6 1 rs372319358 0 16068 C Tsnp_bim_data &amp;lt;- read.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn preparation for merging the two sets of genomic data, some basic statistics must first be generated. These will include allele frequencies, genotyping rates, missingness, and hardy-weinberg equilibrium tests.
Methods1.Generate allele frequencies for both filesplink1.9 --bfile NI_wgs_merged_snps --freq --out plink_output/wgs_allele_freqplink1.9 --bfile NImerged.impute2.chrAllX-2014-Oct-02 --freq --out plink_output/snp_allele_freqView head of output2.Plot histograms of allele frequency distributions in both files3.Generate missingness statisticsplink1.</description>

      <description>IntroductionSince the genomic data is in two separate files, they need to be merged to create a unified data set that should contain genome-wide SNP coverage for over 600 NI individuals. Eventually, only the data for the individuals that were part of the NIES will be retained, which should include data for about 300 individuals. The merge will be performed on PLINK using the âbmergeâ function. To try this, I will be using a small subset of data to familiarise myself with the function and its output.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter cleaning the phenotypic data and performing PCA, the first part of Aim 1 is completed. The second part will involve cleaing and performing PCA on the genomic data. The genomic data is currently in two separate files as they were generated using two different methods (SNP-array and WGS) for different studies. 506 individuals have SNP-array data, and 108 have WGS data, although not all of these individuals were part of the NIES.</description>
