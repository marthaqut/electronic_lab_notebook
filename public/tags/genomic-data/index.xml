      <description>IntroductionAfter addressing the missing genotype filtering issue, the PCA on the final data set will need to be repeated. Performing a PCA will reveal population structure and will reveal any underlying genetic structures in the genomic data.
Methods and ResultsNote: I forgot to change the paternal and maternal IDs before I re-did the merge and it seemed to be causing issues with the PCA. I changed the paternal and maternal IDs in the final data set (nies_miss_filtered) ONLY.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe missing genotype filtering is still removing more variants than expected. We suspect that PLINK may not be handling the overlapping data/duplicate samples well. Therefore, I will be removing the SNP-array data for individuals that have duplicate data before attempting to merge the data set using the default setting (consensus calls) in PLINK.
Methods and Results1. Identify individuals with SNP-array only and duplicate data.Using the master spreadsheet containing UUIDs, I 1) isolated all NIES individuals, 2) isolated NIES individuals with SNP data (GWAS_NIES), 3) separate individuals with potential duplicates and SNP-array data.</description>

      <description>IntroductionApplying a missing genotype filter for individuals and markers (described in previous entry) yielded unexpected results as a significant number of individuals and variants were removed. Considering the high genotyping rates (~99%) of the original files (WGS and SNP-array), there should only be a small number of variants removed due to missing genotypes.
This exercise is aimed at determining the possible cause for this filtering issue by testing the filtering parameters on the original data set and merged data set.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe final step to the second part of aim 1 is to perform a PCA on the genomic data to investigate the population structure. This is important because it will allow me to determine if there are any underlying genetic structures in the genomic data and I can account for relatedness among individuals for subsequent analyses.
Methods and Results1. Run PCAplink1.9 --bfile merged_nies --pca 180 var-wts --out plink_output/nies_final_pcaThe count had to be increased (default is 20) because there are over 100 components with an eigenvalue &amp;gt;1.</description>

      <guid>/posts/generating-stats-for-merged-data-and-extracting-data-for-nies/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionNow that the merge has been successful and there should no longer be duplicated individuals, general stats need to be performed on the merged data set. Subsequently, the final step to this data prep and cleaning is to extract data for the NIES individuals only.
Methods and ResultsNote: Most processes up until the merge from the previous entry was performed on taurus. I transferred filtered_merge to local directory. These stat tests will be performed locally.</description>

      <description>IntroductionPrior to merging the data sets, I need to fix the IDs in the WGS data as they are not UUIDs and are therefore recognising all individuals as unique despite having an overlap.
Methods and Results1. Load WGS fam filewgs_fam_data &amp;lt;- read.table(&amp;#39;C:/Users/Martha/Documents/Honours/Project/honours.project/Data/plink_output/wgs_filtered.fam&amp;#39;, header = F)head(wgs_fam_data)## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6## 1 1 110390 0 0 2 -9## 2 1 110990 0 0 1 -9## 3 1 111280 0 0 2 -9## 4 1 111800 0 0 2 -9## 5 1 111830 0 0 2 -9## 6 1 124520 0 0 1 -92.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe merge function in PLINK appears to exclude variants that are common in both data sets, which is unexpected.The following work around extracts the variants common in both file sets and merges the data.
NOTE: this exercise was performed on taurus.
Methods and Results1. Extract SNP IDs from both .bim files and sort them numerically.awk &amp;#39;{print $2}&amp;#39; NI.snp.hg38_final.bim | sort &amp;gt; array_snp_hg38_sorted.txtawk &amp;#39;{print $2}&amp;#39; NI_wgs_merged_snps.bim | sort &amp;gt; wgs_snp_hg38_sorted.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter obtaining the unfiltered WGS data and converting the SNP-array data to a hg38 genome reference build, I can generate basic stats, QC, and merge. There should not be anymore changes to the base data sets moving forward.
Methods and Results1.Find allele frequencies in both file setsplink1.9 --bfile NI.snp.hg38_final --freq --out plink_output/snp_allele_freqOutput: - 26,055,300 variants loaded - 506 individuals (247 males, 259 females) - 45 founders - genotyping rate is 98.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe SNP array was imputed using hg19 coordinates which is conflicting with the hg38 build (used for WGS). Therefore, the array data has to be converted to hg38 before re-running all summary statistics and further analyses.
Methods1.Access taurus through WinSCP2.Transfer files from local directory to remote directory/data/all/martha

      <description>IntroductionMerging the two genomic data sets caused an error because my laptop has inadequate RAM to perform the merge in a single command. Therefore, I will split the data and merge them by chromosome and stitch these together to create a unified merged file set.
Method1. Use ‘for’ loop to split SNP data by chromosomefor i in {1..23}do plink1.9 --bfile plink_output/snp_exclude --chr $i --make-bed --out merged_chr_data/snp_chr$idone2.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter performing basic stats and QC on the genomic data sets, merging, and subsetting the data for NIES individuals, a few issues came to my attention. Firstly, from the histograms of the distribution of allele frequencies from the whole genome sequencing data, it became evident that the data had been filtered to exlude SNPs with MAF &amp;lt; 0.05. Thus any rare variants that I need for GWAS was excluded. Second, the IDs in the whole genome sequencing data were not UUIDs.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter extracting data for the common variants, the last cleaning step is to extract genomic data for NIES individuals only. Unique identifiers are used for individuals and a unique list of UUIDs need to be identified to extract the relevant data.
Methods and ResultsLoad .fam file from the merged data set. (.fam file contains UUIDs of individuals with genomic data)merged_fam_data &amp;lt;- read.table(&amp;#39;C:/Users/Martha/Documents/Honours/Project/honours.project/Data/plink_output/common_id_merge.fam&amp;#39;, header = F)head(merged_fam_data)## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6## 1 1 110050 764 368910 1 -9## 2 1 110110 2621 400796 1 -9## 3 1 110130 2994 2330 1 -9## 4 1 110150 0 0 2 -9## 5 1 110160 2070 2071 1 -9## 6 1 110320 4462 6317 1 -92.</description>

      <description>IntroductionError when extracting common variant IDs needs to be resolved.
After successfully exporting the list of common IDs, the relevant genomic data will need to be extracted and basic statistics will need to be generated.
Methods and resultsI believe the error in PLINK when extracting data is due to the formatting of the IDs in the text file.
1.Try removing quotation marks from the list of IDs</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe merged data set did not produce the expected output. I expected that the merging would only retain data from common variants between both genomic data sets. To resolve this, I need to compare the two data sets and extract the list of common variant IDs and use this to extract the relevant data.
Methods1.Load .bim files for both data sets

      <description>IntroductionIn preparation for merging the two sets of genomic data, some basic statistics must first be generated. These will include allele frequencies, genotyping rates, missingness, and hardy-weinberg equilibrium tests.

      <description>IntroductionSince the genomic data is in two separate files, they need to be merged to create a unified data set that should contain genome-wide SNP coverage for over 600 NI individuals. Eventually, only the data for the individuals that were part of the NIES will be retained, which should include data for about 300 individuals. The merge will be performed on PLINK using the ‘bmerge’ function. To try this, I will be using a small subset of data to familiarise myself with the function and its output.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter cleaning the phenotypic data and performing PCA, the first part of Aim 1 is completed. The second part will involve cleaing and performing PCA on the genomic data. The genomic data is currently in two separate files as they were generated using two different methods (SNP-array and WGS) for different studies. 506 individuals have SNP-array data, and 108 have WGS data, although not all of these individuals were part of the NIES.</description>
