      <description># required packagesrequire(tidyverse)require(broom)require(missMDA)require(FactoMineR)require(moments)require(Hmisc)require(corrplot)IntroductionThe results of the Pearson correlations between the phenotypic variables, indicate that there were several correlated variables, that were not due to being left and right values of the same variable. For example, the keratometry measurements were negatively correlated with axial length. These relationships suggest that there is an underlying component, or a latent phenotype, that may better explain these variables.</description>

      <description># required packagesrequire(tidyverse)require(broom)require(missMDA)require(FactoMineR)require(moments)require(Hmisc)require(corrplot)IntroductionUpon inspection of the current data set being used, we realised that there was a variable missing. The variable was a total meausure of conjunctival ultraviolet fluorescence (UVAF). This was included in the original NI Eye Study and therefore, we decided to introduce the variable to this study.

      <description>IntroductionThe histograms and outliers have not revealed any non-sense data - in a statistical sense. However, the data that was collected from the eye examinations as part of the NIES in 2008 was not accompanied with a comprehensive glossary. In order to understand the measurements, and determine whether some values are outside of the possible measurable outcomes, compiling a glossary would be useful.
