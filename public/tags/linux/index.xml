      <description>IntroductionSince the genomic data is in two separate files, they need to be merged to create a unified data set that should contain genome-wide SNP coverage for over 600 NI individuals. Eventually, only the data for the individuals that were part of the NIES will be retained, which should include data for about 300 individuals. The merge will be performed on PLINK using the ‘bmerge’ function. To try this, I will be using a small subset of data to familiarise myself with the function and its output.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter cleaning the phenotypic data and performing PCA, the first part of Aim 1 is completed. The second part will involve cleaing and performing PCA on the genomic data. The genomic data is currently in two separate files as they were generated using two different methods (SNP-array and WGS) for different studies. 506 individuals have SNP-array data, and 108 have WGS data, although not all of these individuals were part of the NIES.</description>
