      <description>IntroductionAfter performing basic stats and QC on the genomic data sets, merging, and subsetting the data for NIES individuals, a few issues came to my attention. Firstly, from the histograms of the distribution of allele frequencies from the whole genome sequencing data, it became evident that the data had been filtered to exlude SNPs with MAF &amp;lt; 0.05. Thus any rare variants that I need for GWAS was excluded. Second, the IDs in the whole genome sequencing data were not UUIDs.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter extracting data for the common variants, the last cleaning step is to extract genomic data for NIES individuals only. Unique identifiers are used for individuals and a unique list of UUIDs need to be identified to extract the relevant data.
Methods and ResultsLoad .fam file from the merged data set. (.fam file contains UUIDs of individuals with genomic data)merged_fam_data &amp;lt;- read.table(&amp;#39;C:/Users/Martha/Documents/Honours/Project/honours.project/Data/plink_output/common_id_merge.fam&amp;#39;, header = F)head(merged_fam_data)## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6## 1 1 110050 764 368910 1 -9## 2 1 110110 2621 400796 1 -9## 3 1 110130 2994 2330 1 -9## 4 1 110150 0 0 2 -9## 5 1 110160 2070 2071 1 -9## 6 1 110320 4462 6317 1 -92.</description>

      <description>IntroductionError when extracting common variant IDs needs to be resolved.
After successfully exporting the list of common IDs, the relevant genomic data will need to be extracted and basic statistics will need to be generated.
Methods and resultsI believe the error in PLINK when extracting data is due to the formatting of the IDs in the text file.
1.Try removing quotation marks from the list of IDs</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe merged data set did not produce the expected output. I expected that the merging would only retain data from common variants between both genomic data sets. To resolve this, I need to compare the two data sets and extract the list of common variant IDs and use this to extract the relevant data.
Methods1.Load .bim files for both data sets
wgs_bim_data &amp;lt;- read.table(&amp;#39;C:/Users/Martha/Documents/Honours/Project/honours.project/Data/NI_wgs_merged_snps.bim&amp;#39;, header = F)head(wgs_bim_data)## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6## 1 1 1:11075 0 11075 A G## 2 1 rs546169444 0 14464 T A## 3 1 rs2691315 0 15820 T G## 4 1 rs375964566 0 15922 G A## 5 1 rs112448831 0 15956 A G## 6 1 rs372319358 0 16068 C Tsnp_bim_data &amp;lt;- read.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn preparation for merging the two sets of genomic data, some basic statistics must first be generated. These will include allele frequencies, genotyping rates, missingness, and hardy-weinberg equilibrium tests.
Methods1.Generate allele frequencies for both filesplink1.9 --bfile NI_wgs_merged_snps --freq --out plink_output/wgs_allele_freqplink1.9 --bfile NImerged.impute2.chrAllX-2014-Oct-02 --freq --out plink_output/snp_allele_freqView head of output2.Plot histograms of allele frequency distributions in both files3.Generate missingness statisticsplink1.</description>

      <description>IntroductionSince the genomic data is in two separate files, they need to be merged to create a unified data set that should contain genome-wide SNP coverage for over 600 NI individuals. Eventually, only the data for the individuals that were part of the NIES will be retained, which should include data for about 300 individuals. The merge will be performed on PLINK using the ‘bmerge’ function. To try this, I will be using a small subset of data to familiarise myself with the function and its output.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAfter cleaning the phenotypic data and performing PCA, the first part of Aim 1 is completed. The second part will involve cleaing and performing PCA on the genomic data. The genomic data is currently in two separate files as they were generated using two different methods (SNP-array and WGS) for different studies. 506 individuals have SNP-array data, and 108 have WGS data, although not all of these individuals were part of the NIES.</description>
