      <description>IntroductionThe original dataset that was used for descriptive statistics in previous entries contained data for all 801 individuals. However, the ethics approval for this study only allows for adult data to be included in the study. All data for minor individuals must therefore be removed. Additionally, relevant quantitative variables must be selected from the bigger phenotypic dataset since not all quantitative measurements are endophenotypes.
AimRemove data for minor individuals and subset relevant quantitative measures.</description>

      <description>IntroductionFinding outliers in a dataset help identify any non-sense data that may not be obvious from the histograms. If they are not non-sense, they may be present due to measurement variability or it may indicate an error. Regardless, it is important to identify outliers as they can significantly affect the results of subsequent statistical analyses and it may be necessary to exclude them from the dataset prior to data imputation.</description>

      <description>IntroductionHistograms show the frequency distribution of continuous data. It can also be used to inspect whether the data is normally distributed, skewed, and indicate the presence of outliers or non-sense data. The continuous data is split into intervals called bins, and the frequency of scores that fit within each bin is recorded and plotted. Since the data is continuous, histograms are plotted with no spaces in between each bar. (https://statistics.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe phenotypic data collected from the eye examinations in 2008 were collated in a single excel file. The file contains data from all 801 study participants, including their demographic, environmental, and quantitative phenotypic data. There are also comments on clinical observations. Prior to analysing the phenotypic data, it is important to identify any missing or non-sense data so as not to interfere with the analyses or its results.
AimTo identify missing and non-sense data from the phenotypic dataset.</description>
