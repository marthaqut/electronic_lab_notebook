      <description>IntroductionRecent studies suggest that hidden population stratification can singificantly inflate heritability estimates. It is therefore imperative that population structure is accounted for when estimating heritability by including principal components in the linear mixed model. Typically, 10 to 20 principal components are used for this correction in outbred populations, but these numbers have no theoretical basis. A paper by Dandine-Roulland et al. (2016) has shown that heritability estimates are significantly affected with the inclusion of the first principal component, but not of any more (https://www.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe genetic relationship matrix generated from the previous exercise contains values that signify the degree of relatedness between the individuals. This will allow me to estimate the heritability of the traits and principal components identified in the first objective.
To recap this concept, traits can vary among individuals due to environmental and genetic factors. Estimating the heritability of a trait means determining the proportion of variance that can be attributed to genetics (https://www.</description>

      <description>require(gaston)IntroductionGaston is an R package that allows for manipulation and analysis of SNP data. For this project, it will be used to estimate heritability of the phenotypes and perform the pedigree-based linear mixed model GWAS (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gaston/vignettes/gaston.pdf).
Methods and Results1. Re-filter the SNP data.In the previous entry, I manually subsetted data for individuals before merging the data sets such that PLINK does not have to handle duplicate samples.</description>
