      <description>I respect the design of the temple theme for hugo and it‚Äôs goal of been minimal, lightweight and fast - it‚Äôs formed a great background framework for this design of an Electronic Lab Notebook. However, I always like a darker theme for my code (writing and highlighting) and I couldn‚Äôt find a ‚Äòsimple‚Äô solution in terms of editing the config.toml (though my css isn‚Äôt up to scratch and I‚Äôm sure there is a nice way there‚Ä¶).</description>

      <description>Global options It‚Äôs a good idea to set some global default options.
# setting some default options options(blogdown.ext = &amp;#39;.Rmd&amp;#39;, blogdown.subdir = &amp;#39;posts&amp;#39;) NOTE: to avoid running this each session it is best to set these options in your .Rprofile so they take effect when launching RStudio
 see https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/global-options.html for details around this   Dynamic (live updating) previews of your site At the start of each session make sure you run the serve function.</description>

      <description>To get access to emojis set the following flag in the config.toml file:
enableEmoji = true  Note: for emojis to be interpreted correctly your file needs to be an .Rmarkdown file, .Rmd won&amp;rsquo;t work.
This should mean that emojis work: üòÑ ü§ò üíÄ
Here is a cheatsheet of emoji codes: https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/
An R package for emojis The package emo(ji) allows the insertion of emoji using R.
# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;) devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;hadley/emo&amp;quot;)  Load the package:</description>

      <description>This is a simple example of setting up an electronic lab notebook using blogdown and the static site generator hugo.
The theme used it this example is a slightly modified version of temple, which is a minimal, distraction free theme suitable for electronic notebooking (in my opinion). If interested, you can find a large list of hugo themes here: https://themes.gohugo.io/
The overall setup here involves each notebook entry (post) to be assigned at least one category, i.</description>

      <description>Markdown checkboxes We can create to-do lists for specific days/projects/assignments etc, here‚Äôs an example:
 [x] Learn about RMarkdown [x] Set up an electronic lab notebook [ ] Perform a simple regression [ ] Load some data and clean it  ‚Ä¶ and the Markdown that creates this:
- [x] Learn about RMarkdown - [x] Set up an electronic lab notebook - [ ] Perform a simple regression - [ ] Load some data and clean it  HTML checkboxes It seems that when using Netlify to host the notebook the checkboxes don‚Äôt display, this will be due to the ‚Äòflavour‚Äô of markdown used.</description>

      <description>Linear regression We will use the mtcars data, specifically the miles per gallon (mpg) versus the weight (wt) - we obviously expect to see a strong association between these two variables.

      <description>The recent introduction of the R package reticulate now allows for the seemless integration of Python coding into an R workflow. Here I‚Äôll provide a very simple, quick example using reticulate in an RMarkdown document within RStudio, for further detail see https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate#python-in-r-markdown.
Setting up Install the reticulate package:
install.packages(&amp;#39;reticulate&amp;#39;)  Running Python within an R chunk We can now directly import packages within an R chunk in RMarkdown:
require(reticulate) # load reticulate package os &amp;lt;- import(&amp;quot;os&amp;quot;) # import os os$listdir(&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Let‚Äôs pretend that you‚Äôve read a great manuscript/article and you want to document some of your thoughts, you can easily do this as an entry in your lab notebook. You can make it simple to track down such entries by adding them to say a ‚ÄòWriting‚Äô category.
You can bullet point your notes using Markdown:
 really good point in the second paragraph of the discussion Figure 3 was very informative interesting results, might be worth checking if data set is available  These can be numbered as well:</description>
