      <description>IntroductionPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is one of the analysis techniques that I will be performing on my data. For the phenotypic dataset, it will be used to impute missing values to obtain a complete dataset. Later on, PCA will be performed to determine principal components of the endophenotypes to identify any latent phenotypes.

      <description>IntroductionThe histograms and outliers have not revealed any non-sense data - in a statistical sense. However, the data that was collected from the eye examinations as part of the NIES in 2008 was not accompanied with a comprehensive glossary. In order to understand the measurements, and determine whether some values are outside of the possible measurable outcomes, compiling a glossary would be useful.
