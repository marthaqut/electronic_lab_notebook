##Introduction 
Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the analysis techniques that I will be performing on my data. For the phenotypic dataset, it will be used to impute missing values to obtain a complete dataset. Later on, PCA will be performed to determine principal components of the endophenotypes to identify any latent phenotypes.
