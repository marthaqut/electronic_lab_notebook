#Introduction
The pedigree-based GWAS identified 9 heritable traits with significant hits (i.e. SNPs that pass genome-wide significance threshold, p < 1.84e-7). The number of significant hits within each trait highly varied. To identify the most robust hits, SNPs that pass the genome-wide signficance threshold would ideally have adjacent SNPs that pass the suggestive threshold. Therefore, I will attempt to filter the significant hits/loci based on the presence of significant (suggestive) SNPs.
