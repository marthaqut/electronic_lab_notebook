<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The merged data set did not produce the expected output. I expected that the merging would only retain data from common variants between both genomic data sets. To resolve this, I need to compare the two data sets and extract the list of common variant IDs and use this to extract the relevant data.</p>
