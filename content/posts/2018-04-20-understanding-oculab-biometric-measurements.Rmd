##Introduction 
The histograms and outliers have not revealed any non-sense data - in a statistical sense. However, the data that was collected from the eye examinations as part of the NIES in 2008 was not accompanied with a comprehensive glossary. In order to understand the measurements, and determine whether some values are outside of the possible measurable outcomes, compiling a glossary would be useful. 

1. Visual acuity - LogMAR test
  - Tests the sharpness of a person's eyes using a letter chart
  - using the logMAR system, the maximum value is 1.0, and the minimum is -0.3 at the standard distance of 20ft (or 6m)
  - if vision is very poor, the chart can be moved closer but a correction must be made to the logMAR score and it can therefore exceed 1.0 (e.g. a distance of 1.5m can have a logMAR score of 1.5)
